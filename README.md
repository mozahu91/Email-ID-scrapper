# Email-ID-scrapper
This code scrapes the email IDs from the Google contacts list

Here are the things that this python script does:

1. Need to download the gmail contacts csv file. Simple export from Gmail shall do.
2. The CSV file I had didn't have any phone numbers to be scrapped or mapped into the data, if numbers exist simple Regex processing shall work.
3. When we specify the path, this script takes the email ID's and creates a new excel file and maps the email IDs into it.

Prerequisites:
1. You need to install pandas if it hasn't been installed.
2. pip install pandas 

I have also attached the test.xls file which was created from the code.
